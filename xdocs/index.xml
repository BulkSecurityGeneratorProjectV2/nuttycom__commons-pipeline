<section name="The Processing Pipeline">
<p>
  This project provides a set of serial processing utilities designed around 
  the concept of a processing pipeline. A pipeline in its simplest form is 
  a series of work queue processors that allow objects to be passed between 
  stages in a sequential fashion.
</p>
<p>
  The primary processing element in a pipeline is called a Stage. A stage contains
  an input queue of objects for which it it is a consumer, and acts a producer 
  of processed objects for subsequent stages and pipeline branches. A stage can
  act as a filter for data, or may have more complex responsibilities such
  as finding and allocating resources for subsequent stages.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to sequential processing, a simple event model is provided to
  enable asynchronous communication between stages in the pipeline.
